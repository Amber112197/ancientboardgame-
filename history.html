<p id="p4">The Royal Game of Ur, is a two-player strategy race board game that was first played in ancient Mesopotamia during the early third millennium BC.

<p id="p5">Mancala is one of the oldest known games to still be widely played today. Mancala is a generic name for a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective of the game is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces. Versions of the game date back to the 7th century, and evidence suggests the game existed in ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>How to play:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Mancala board is made up of two rows of six holes, or pits, each.</li>
	<li>Four pieces-marbles, chips, or stones-are places in each of the 12 holes.</li>
	<li>Each player has a stone(called a Mancala) to the right side of the Mancala board.</li>
	<li>The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on their side.</li>
